Python coding exercise: Palindrome filter.
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backwards as forwards (e.g.
"detartrated".) Write a script to read any plain text document from stdin. For
example, use the content of this file as a testset. Filter for just the
palindromes that are longer than 1 character. Output them, one per line, to
stdout. Preserve the order of first occurrence, but only output each palindrome
once.

Consider whether your code runs fast like a racecar on large inputs, e.g.
larger than RAM. Under what circumstances might it have to deal with an
infinitely large input stream?

We have a tenet that all non-throwaway code should be well tested, developed
using TDD, and should generally raise on unresolvable errors or ambiguities.

Don't forget to let us know what version of Python you're using, and generally
present your solution so that we can install any dependencies, see your tests
pass, and run your code, with minimum of fuss.
